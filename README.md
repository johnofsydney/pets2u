# pets2u

Please see my best version
`ruby/pet_shop_two.rb`
notes in `ruby/readme.md`

Sequence
  - I did the javascript version first (~3.5 hours)
  `javascript/petShop.js`
  notes in `javascript/readme.md`

  - Then I translated this into ruby (1 hour)
  `ruby/pet_shop.rb`

  - Then I did a re-write to improve the ruby version (1.5 hours)
  `ruby/pet_shop_two.rb`
  This version will work easily with new box sizes & animals. I added a test to prove it.
